# Monty Hall Problem
The Monty Hall problem is named after Monty Hall, the host of the American television game show Let’s Make a Deal. In the show, contestants were often asked to choose between three doors, behind one of which was a valuable prize (like a car), while the other two doors concealed less desirable prizes (like goats). 

After the contestant chose a door, Monty Hall, who knew what was behind each door, would reveal a goat behind one of the two remaining doors. The contestant was then given the option to either stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door.

The mathematical problem based on this scenario demonstrates that switching doors gives the contestant a higher probability (2/3) of winning the car, compared to sticking with the initial choice (1/3). Despite its counterintuitive nature, this has been mathematically proven and sparked much debate when it was popularized.

This repository simulates the outcomes of playing the game many times switching and non switching with less than 50 lines of code and with a live plotting interface as the simulation runs

## Software Dependencies

This code uses the following libraries:
- `streamlit`: for building the user interface.
- `plotly`: for plotting the results
- `pandas`: for storing the data

## Usage
```
git clone ...
python3 -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
pip install streamlit pandas plotly
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the local Streamlit server, and you can access the interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8501`.
